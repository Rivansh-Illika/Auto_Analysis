Skewness: The distribution of ratings_count, work_ratings_count, and ratings_5 shows a positive skew; large values may indicate a few books have significantly more ratings than others.
Outliers: Detected outliers in ratings_count, and work_ratings_count could suggest a few highly popular books dominating these metrics.
